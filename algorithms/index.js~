Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:<ol><li>Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted).</li><li>Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.</li></ol>",
